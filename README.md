## Introduction

Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language. While it is a general purpose language and can be used to write any application, many of its features are well-suited for high-performance numerical analysis and computational science.

This project is a collection of tutorials and examples for the Julia programming language. It is intended to be a resource for learning and teaching Julia. The project is open-source and contributions are welcome.
